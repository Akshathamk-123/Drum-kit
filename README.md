# Drum-kit

Drum-kit:

Drum kit is the website which uses keyboard hits and mouse clicks to produce the sounds of different parts of the Drum. This is project I created while learning Javascript and obviously contains some HTML, CSS and Bootstrap in it.The only motive of this website is to learn about the Javascript basic functioning.
